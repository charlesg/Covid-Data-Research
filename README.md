# Covid-Data-Research

This is a collection on scripts and notes, the result of me
playing with COVID-19 data sets during the pandemic. Following
a few interesting articles I decided to try.

Like with a lot of folks, it all started from work done at John Hopkins
who's data captured the attention of everyone early in the pandemic:

When I found the data was made avaialble on GitHub, I figured I should see
what I can chart from it:

This article is what initially inspired the process:
From https://towardsdatascience.com/analyzing-coronavirus-covid-19-data-using-pandas-and-plotly-2e34fe2c4edc

The last chart is inspired by work from Aatish Bhatia at:

The 'venv' was built with virtualenv as a new project in PyCharm.

## DeepNote

I took this project and compared various Jupyter platforms.
A similar notebook was put up on DeedNote, a new and innovative
Jupyter like platform where realtime collaboration is possible:

## Colab

As I was comparing online Jupyter/Python tools (other than Jupyter Lab),
I ran similar notebooks on Google's Colaboratory:
